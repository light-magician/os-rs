  when turn on comp, it executes firmware code
  that is stored in motherboard ROM

    Motherboard ROM
        
        is a non-volitile memory chip embedded on the motherboard
        that stores the computer's firmware, most commonly
        BIOS or UEFI. 
        
        It is "read-only" meaning its contents don't get erased
        when the computer powers off.

        when you turn on the comp, the CPU immediately 
        executes the instructions stored in ROM.

        these instructions handle power-on self tests,
        detect hardware, and bootstrap the OS by 
        loading the bootloader from disk or another
        device

        modern systems often use flashable ROM so the 
        firmware can be updated, but the concept remains
        the same: it's the machines earliest code. 

    BIOS

        Basic Input Output system

        unified extensible firmware interface

        bios is supported on any x86 machine since the 
        1980s 

        UEFI has more features and is harder to setup
